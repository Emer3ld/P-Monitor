# Configure WiFi from Command Line with Raspi-Config

### If you are running a server distribution of Raspberry Pi OS without a GUI, you will have to use Raspi-Config instead. This method works in Raspberry Pi OS Desktop as well.
Raspi-Config is a console based application used to configure various settings on the Raspberry Pi. It can be used for network configuration, setting up remote access, boot options etc.
To open Raspi-Config n the command line, type the command:

sudo raspi-config

Select Wi-fi, then follow the on-screen instructions to enter your network’s SSID and password. When you’re done, select “Finish” on the main menu to close Raspi-Config.
Finally, reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the settings we’ve just changed. Your WiFi connection should then be good to go!
