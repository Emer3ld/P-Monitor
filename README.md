# Plant-Monitor
We have been set tasks to create a plant monitoring device using code already provided by the course tutor. An additional part of this task is to incorporate an additional way of adding elements to monitor our plant system. I have chosen to add the function of LED lighting to decipher the plant's most basic needs. Naming the plant monitoring device Chroma Lumiere is based on the concept of chromatophores a colour-changing plant pot where changing colours of light are translating what the plant needs on the fundamental requirements i.e. light, Water and humidity.

** The tools and code we need for our plant monitoring system in order are:
1. Installation and setup of Arduino IDE
2. AdaFruit Feather Huzzah board & libraries.
3. Code for writing to our readings to MQTT.
4. Installation of Raspberry Pi iOS(for Mac users).
5. Specifications for setting up Influx DB using shell, I will include a troubleshooting folder.
6. Installing Grafana.
