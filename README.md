# Plant-Monitor (Chroma- Lumiere)
We have been set tasks to create a plant monitoring device using code already provided by course tutor. An additional part of this task is to incorporate an additional way of adding elements to monitor our plant system. I have chosen to add the function of LED lighting to decipher the plants most basic needs. Naming the plant monitoring device Chroma Lumiere is based on the concept of chromatophores a colour changing plant pot where changing colours of light are translating what the plant needs on the fundamental requirements i.e. light, Water and humdity.

** The tools and code we need for our plant monitoring system in order are:
1. Installation of Arduino IDE
2. AdaFruit Feather Huzzah board & libraries.
3. Code for writing to our readings to MQTT.
4. Istallation of Rapberry Pi ios(for Mac users).
5. Specifications for setting up Influx DB using shell, I will include a troubleshooting folder.
6. Installing Grafana.
